## Summary

Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) was added to Kubernetes as an alpha feature in
v1.26. It defines an alternative to the traditional device-plugin API for
requesting access to third-party resources.

By design, DRA uses parameters for resources that are completely
opaque to core Kubernetes. They get interpreted by a DRA driver's controller
(for allocating claims) and a DRA driver's kubelet plugin (for configuring
resources on a node). During scheduling of a pod, the kube-scheduler and any DRA
driver controller(s) handling claims for the pod communicate back-and-forth through the
apiserver by updating a `PodSchedulingContext` object, ultimately leading to the
allocation of all pending claims and the pod being scheduled onto a node.

This approach poses a problem for the [Cluster
Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler) (CA) or for any higher
level controller that needs to make decisions for a group of pods (e.g. a job
scheduler). It cannot simulate the effect of allocating or deallocating
claims over time. Only the third-party DRA drivers have the information
available to do this.

"Structured parameters" is an extension to DRA that addresses this problem by
making claim parameters less opaque. Instead of handling the semantics of all
claim parameters themselves, drivers now manage resources and describe them
using a specific "structured model" pre-defined by Kubernetes. This allows
components aware of this "structured model" to make decisions about these
resources without outsourcing them to some third-party controller. For example,
the scheduler is now able to allocate claims rapidly, without back-and-forth
communication with DRA drivers.

At a high-level, this extension takes the following form:

* DRA drivers publish their available resources in the form of a
  `NodeResourceSlice` object on a node-by-node basis according to one or more of the
  builtin "structured models" known to Kubernetes. This object is stored in the
  API server and available to the scheduler (or Cluster Autoscaler) to query
  when a resource request comes in later on.

* When a user wants to consume a resource, they create a `ResourceClaim`,
  which, in turn, references a claim parameters object. This object defines how
  many resources are needed and which capabilities they must have. Typically, it
  is defined using a vendor-specific type which might also support configuration
  parameters (i.e. parameters that are *not* needed for allocation but *are*
  needed for configuration).

* With such a claim in place, DRA drivers "resolve" the contents of any
  vendor-specific claim parameters into a canonical form (i.e. a generic
  `ResourceClaimParameters` object in the `resource.k8s.io` API group) which
  the scheduler (or Cluster Autoscaler) can evaluate against the
  `NodeResourceSlice` of any candidate nodes without knowing exactly what is
  being requested. They then use this information to help decide which node to
  schedule a pod on (as well as allocate resources from its `NodeResourceSlice`
  in the process).

* Once a node is chosen and the allocation decisions made, the scheduler will
  store the result in the API server as well as update its in-memory model of
  available resources. DRA drivers are responsible for using this allocation
  result to inject any allocated resource into the Pod, according to
  the resource choices made by the scheduler. This includes applying any
  configuration information attached to the vendor-specific claim parameters
  object used in the request.

This KEP is specifically focused on defining the framework necessary to enable
different "structured models" to be added to Kuberenetes over time. It is out of
scope to actually define one of these model themselves.

Instead, we provide an example of how one might map the way resources are
exposed by the traditional device-plugin API into a "structured model". We don't
believe this model is expressive enough to satify the majority of the use-cases
we want to cover with DRA, but it's useful enough to demonstrate the overall
"structured parameters" framework.

## Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals, and non-goals of
this KEP.  Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users. The
motivation section can optionally provide links to [experience reports] to
demonstrate the interest in a KEP within the wider Kubernetes community.

[experience reports]: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/ExperienceReports
-->

### Goals

- Enable cluster autoscaling when pods use resource claims, with correct
  decisions and changing the cluster size by more than one node at a time.

- Support node-local resources. Adding or removing nodes has no effect
  on network-attached resources and therefore CA does not need to (and cannot)
  simulate them.

- Allow DRA driver developers to provide a user experience that is similar to
  the one possible without structured parameters. Ideally, users should not notice
  at all that a driver is using structured parameters under the hood.

### Non-Goals

- Scheduling performance is expected to become better compared to using the
  PodSchedulingContext. However, this is not the reason for this KEP.


## Proposal

### Publishing node resources

The resources available on a node need to be published to the API server. In
the typical case, this is expected to be published by the on-node driver via
the kubelet, as described below. However, the source of this data may vary; for
example, a cloud provider controller could populate this based upon information
from the cloud provider API.

In the kubelet case, each kubelet publishes kubelet publishes a set of
`NodeResourceSlice` objects to the API server with content provided by the
corresponding DRA drivers running on its node. Access control through the node
authorizer ensures that the kubelet running on one node is not allowed to
create or modify `NodeResourceSlices` belonging to another node. A `nodeName`
field in each `NodeResourceSlice` object is used to determine which objects are
managed by which kubelet.

**NOTE:**  `NodeResourceSlices` are published separately for each driver, using
whatever version of the `resource.k8s.io` API is supported by the kubelet. That
same version is then also used in the gRPC interface between the kubelet and
the DRA drivers providing content for those objects. It might be possible to
support version skew (= keeping kubelet at an older version than the control
plane and the DRA drivers) in the future, but currently this is out of scope.

Embedded inside each `NodeResourceSlice` is the representation of the resources
managed by a driver according to a specific "structured model". In the example
seen below, the structured model in use is called `namedResourcesWithAttributes`:

```yaml
kind: NodeResourceSlice
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1alpha2
...
spec:
  nodeName: worker-1
  driverName: cards.dra.example.com
  namedResourcesWithAttributes:
    ...
```

Such a model could be created to represent resources in a manner similar to the
opaque strings passed over the tradition device plugin API to the kubelet. The
one addition being that each named resource can have a set of arbitrary
attributes attached to it.

If a driver wanted to use a different structured model to represent its resources,
a new structured model would need to be defined inside Kuberenetes, and a field
would need to be added to this struct at the same level as
`namedResourcesWithAttributes`. Driver implementors would then have the option
to set this new field instead.

**Note:** If a new model is added to the schema but clients are not updated,
they'll encounter an object with no information from any known structured model
when they serialize into their known version of a `NodeResourceSlice`. This
tells them that they cannot handle the object because the API has been extended.

Drivers can use different structured models by publishing multiple
`NodeResourceSlice` objects, as long as each model represents a distinct set of
resources. Whether the information about resources of one particular structured
model must fit into one NodeResourceSlice object (or be distributed across
many) depends on how that particular structured model describes its resources. In
all cases, the size of each object is a hard limit and one must take this into
account when designing a structured model and preparing NodeResourceSlice objects
for it.

Below is an example of a driver that provides two discrete GPU cards using the
`namedResourcesWithAttributes` model described above:

```yaml
kind: NodeResourceSlice
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1alpha2
...
spec:
  nodeName: worker-1
  driverName: cards.dra.example.com
  namedResourcesWithAttributes:
  - name: gpu-0
    attributes:
    - name: UUID
      string: GPU-ceea231c-4257-7af7-6726-efcb8fc2ace9
    - name: driverVersion
      version: 1.2.3
    - name: runtimeVersion
      version: 11.1.42
    - name: memory
      quantity: 16Gi
    - name: productName:
      string: ACME T1000 32GB
  - name: gpu-1
    attributes:
    - name: UUID
      string: GPU-6aa0af9e-a2be-88c8-d2b3-2240d25318d7
    - name: driverVersion
      version: 1.2.3
    - name: runtimeVersion
      version: 11.1.42
    - name: memory
      quantity: 32Gi
    - name: productName:
      string: ACME A4-PCIE-40GB
```

Where "gpu-0" represents one type of card and "gpu-1" represents another (with
the attributes hanging off each serving to "define" their individual
properties).

Compared to labels, attributes in this model have values of exactly one type. As
described later on, these attributes can be used in CEL expressions to select a
specific resource for allocation on a node.

While this model is still hypothetical, we do imagine real-world models
attaching attributes to their resources in a similar way. To avoid any future
conflicts, we plan to reserve any attributes with the ".k8s.io" suffix for
future use and standardization by Kubernetes. This could be used to describe
topology across resources from different vendors, for example, but this is out-
of-scope for now.

**Note:** If a driver needs to reduce resource capacity, then there is a risk
that a claim gets allocated using that capacity while the kubelet is updating a
`NodeResourceSlice`. The implementations of structured models must handle
scenarios where more resources are allocated than available. The kubelet plugin
of a DRA driver ***must*** double-check that the allocated resources are still
available when NodePrepareResource is called. If not, the pod cannot start until
the resource comes back. Treating this as a fatal error during pod admission
would allow us to delete the pod and trying again with a new one.

### Using structured parameters

The following is an example CRD which the developer of the
`cards.dra.example.com` DRA driver might define as a valid claim parameters
object for requesting access to its GPUs:

```yaml
kind: CardParameters
apiVersion: dra.example.com/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: my-parameters
  namespace: user-namespace
  uid: foobar-uid
...
spec:
  minimumRuntimeVersion: v12.0.0
  minimumMemory: 32Gi
  # "sharing" is a configuration parameter that does not
  # get translated into the selector below.
  sharing:
    strategy: TimeSliced
```

Note that all fields in this CRD can be fully validated since it is owned by
the DRA driver itself. This includes value ranges that are specific to the
underlying hardware. There's no risk of using invalid attribute names because
only the fields shown here are valid.

With this CRD in place, a DRA driver controller is able to convert instances of
it into a generic, in-tree `ResourceClaimParameters` object that the scheduler
is able to understand.

For the example above, the converted object would look as follows:

```yaml
kind: ResourceClaimParameters
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1alpha2

metadata:
  # This cannot be the same as my-parameters because parameter objects with a different
  # type might also use it. Instead, the original object gets linked to below.
  name: someArbitraryName
  namespace: user-namespace

generatedFrom:
  name: my-parameters
  kind: CardParameters
  apiGroup: dra.example.com
  uid: foobar-uid

vendorParameters:
  # A vendor can put any kind of object here to pass the configuration
  # parameters down to the kubelet plugin. In this case, the vendor
  # driver simply copied the entire CR. It could also be some
  # separate, smaller configuration type.
  #
  # Beware that ResourceClaimParameters have separate RBAC rules than
  # the vendor CRD, so information included here may get visible
  # to more users than the original CRD. Both objects are in the same
  # namespace.
  kind: CardParameters
  apiVersion: dra.example.com/v1alpha1
  metadata:
    name: my-parameters
    namespace: user-namespace
    uid: foobar-uid
  ...
  spec:
    minimumRuntimeVersion: v12.0.0
    minimumMemory: 32Gi
    sharing:
      strategy: TimeSliced

requests:
- driverName: cards.dra.example.com
  namedResourcesWithAttributes:
    required:
    # Selectors are CEL expressions with access to the attributes of the named resource
    # that is being checked for a match. Each entry here is a request for one resource.
    - selector: |-
        attributes["runtimeVersion"] >= "v12.0.0" && attributes["memory"] >= "32Gi"
```

The meaning is that the selector expression must evaluate to true for a
particular named resource in `namedResourcesWithAttributes`.

Future extensions could be added to support partioning of resources as well as a
express constraints that must be satisfied *between* any selected resources. For
example, selecting two cards which are on the same PCI root complex may be
needed to get the required performance.

Instead of defining a vendor-specific CRD, DRA driver authors (or
administrators) could decide to allow users to create and reference
`ResourceClaimParameters` directly within their `ResourceClaims`. This would
avoid the translation step shown above, but at the cost of (1) providing per-
claim configuration parameters for their requested resources, and (2) doing any
sort of validation on the CEL expressions created by the user.

Resource class parameters are supported the same way. To ensure that
permissions can be limited to administrators, there's a separate cluster-scoped
ResourceClassParameters type. Instead of individual requests, one additional
selector can be specified there which then also must be true for all individual
requests made with that class:

```yaml
kind: ResourceClassParameters
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1alpha2

metadata:
  name: someArbitraryName

generatedFrom:
  name: gpu-parameters
  kind: CardClassParameters
  apiGroup: dra.example.com
  uid: foobar-uid

vendorParameters:
  ...

filters:
- driverName: cards.dra.example.com
  namedResourcesWithAttributes:
    selector: |-
      attributes["memory"] <= "16Gi"
```

In this example, the additional selector expression limits users of this class
to just the cards with less that "16Gi" of memory. Together with limiting the
number of claims that users are allowed to create for this class (see resource
quotas in the core KEP) this can ensure that users do not consume too many
resources. Allowing resource quotas that are based on resource attributes may be
a useful future enhancement.

### Communicating allocation to the DRA driver

The scheduler decides which resources to use for a claim and how much of
them. It also needs to pass through the opaque vendor parameters, if there are
any. This accurately captures the configuration parameters as they were set
at the time of allocation.

All of this information gets stored in the allocation result inside the
ResourceClaim status. For the example above, the result produced by the
scheduler is simply the list of IDs of the selected named resource:

```yaml
# Matches with the StructuredResourceHandle Go type defined below.
vendorClassParameters:
  ...
vendorClaimParameters:
  kind: CardParameters
  apiVersion: dra.example.com/v1alpha1
  metadata:
    name: my-parameters
    namespace: user-namespace
    uid: foobar-uid
  ...
  spec:
    count: 2
    minimumRuntimeVersion: v12.0.0
    minimumMemory: 32Gi
    sharing:
      strategy: TimeSliced

nodeName: worker-1
namedResourcesWithAttributes:
  resources:
  - gpu-1
```

## Design Details

### ResourceClass extension

A new, optional field in ResourceClass enables structured parameters for claims
using this class:

```go
type ResourceClass struct {
    ...

    // If (and only if) allocation of claims using this class is handled
    // via structured parameters, then StructuredParameters must be set to true.
    StructuredParameters bool
}
```

### NodeResourceSlice

For each node, one or more NodeResourceSlice objects get created. The kubelet
publishes them with the node as the owner, so they get deleted when a node goes
down and then gets removed.

All list types are atomic because that makes tracking the owner for
server-side-apply (SSA) simpler. Patching individual list elements is not
needed and there is a single owner (kubelet).

```go
// NodeResourceSlice provides information about available
// resources on individual nodes.
type NodeResourceSlice struct {
    metav1.TypeMeta
    // Standard object metadata
    // +optional
    metav1.ObjectMeta

    Spec NodeResourceSliceSpec
}
```

There is only a spec for a NodeResourceSlice at the moment. It holds the
information about available resources. A status is not strictly needed because
the information in the allocated claim statuses is sufficient to determine
which of those resources are reserved for claims.

However, despite the finalizer on the claims it could happen that a well
intentioned but poorly informed user deletes a claim while it is in use.
Therefore adding a status is a useful future extension. That status will
include information about reserved resources (set by schedulers before
allocating a claim) and in-use resources (set by the kubelet). This then
enables conflict resolution when multiple schedulers schedule pods to the same
node because they would be required to set a reservation before proceeding with
the allocation. It also enables detecting inconsistencies and taking actions to
fix those, like deleting pods which use a deleted claim.

```go
type NodeResourceSliceSpec {
    // NodeName identifies the node where the capacity is available.
    // A field selector can be used to list only NodeResources
    // objects with a certain node name.
    NodeName string

    // DriverName identifies the DRA driver providing the capacity information.
    // A field selector can be used to list only NodeResources
    // objects with a certain driver name.
    DriverName string

    NodeResourceModel // inline, field names must not conflict with the ones above
}

// NodeResourceModel must have one and only one field set.
type NodeResourceModel struct {
    NamedResourcesWithAttributes *NamedResourcesWithAttributes
}

type NamedResourcesWithAttributes struct {
    Name  string
    Attributes []Attribute
}

type Attribute struct {
    Name string
    AttributeValue // inline, field names must not conflict
}

// AttributeValue must have one and only one field set.
type AttributeValue {
    Quantity    *resource.Quantity
    Bool        *bool
    Int         *int64
    IntSlice    *[]int64
    String      *string
    StringSlice *[]string
    Version     *SemVersion
}

// A wrapper around https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/blang/semver/v4#Version which
// is encoded as a string. During decoding, it validates that the string
// can be parsed using tolerant parsing (currently trims spaces, removes a "v" prefix,
// adds a 0 patch number to versions with only major and minor components specified,
// and removes leading 0s).
type SemVersion {
   semverv4.Version
}
```

All names must be DNS sub-domains. This excludes the "/" character, therefore
combining different names with that separator to form an ID is valid.


### ResourceClaimParameters

```go
type ResourceClaimParameters struct {
    metav1.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`
    // Standard object metadata
    metav1.ObjectMeta

    // If this object was created from some other resource, then this links
    // back to that resource. This field is used to find the in-tree representation
    // of the claim parameters when the parameter reference of the claim refers
    // to some unknown type.
    GeneratedFrom *ResourceClaimParametersReference

    // Shareable indicates whether the allocated claim is meant to be shareable
    // by multiple consumers at the same time.
    Shareable bool

    // Requests describes all resources that are needed for the allocated claim.
    // A single claim may use resources coming from different drivers.
    Requests []ResourceRequest
}

// ResourceRequest is a request for resources from one particular driver.
type ResourceRequest struct {
    DriverName string
    ResourceRequestModel // inline, fields must not conflict
}

// ResourceRequestModel must have one and only one field set.
type ResourceRequestModel struct {
    NamedResourcesWithAttributes *NamedResourcesWithAttributesRequest
}

type NamedResourcesWithAttributesRequest struct {
    // Selector is a CEL expression which must evaluate to true if a
    // resource is suitable. The language is as defined in
    // https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/
    //
    // In addition, for each supported attribute value type there
    // is a map that resolves to the corresponding value of the
    // instance under evaluation.
    Selector string
}

type NamedResourcesWithAttributesRequests struct {
    Required []NamedResourcesWithAttributes
}
```

### ResourceClassParameters

```go
type ResourceClassParameters struct {
    metav1.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`
    // Standard object metadata
    metav1.ObjectMeta

    // If this object was created from some other resource, then this links
    // back to that resource. This field is used to find the in-tree representation
    // of the claim parameters when the parameter reference of the claim refers
    // to some unknown type.
    GeneratedFrom *ResourceClassParametersReference

    // Filters describes additional contraints that must be met when using the class.
    Filters []ResourceFilter
}

// ResourceFilter is a filter for resources from one particular driver.
type ResourceFilter struct {
    DriverName string
    ResourceFilterModel // inline, fields must not conflict
}

// ResourceFilterModel must have one and only one field set.
type ResourceFilterModel struct {
    NamedResourcesWithAttributes *NamedResourcesWithAttributesFilter
}

type NamedResourcesWithAttributesFilter struct {
    // Selector is a selector like the one in NamedResourcesWithAttributesRequest. It must be
    // true for a resource instance to be suitable for a claim using the class.
    Selector string
}
```

### ResourceHandle extension

The ResourceHandle is embedded inside the claim status. When using structured parameters,
a new field must get populated instead of the opaque driver data.

```go
type ResourceHandle struct {
    // DriverName specifies the name of the resource driver whose kubelet
    // plugin should be invoked to process this ResourceHandle's data once it
    // lands on a node. This may differ from the DriverName set in
    // ResourceClaimStatus this ResourceHandle is embedded in.
    DriverName string

    // Data contains the opaque data associated with this ResourceHandle. It is
    // set by the controller component of the resource driver whose name
    // matches the DriverName set in the ResourceClaimStatus this
    // ResourceHandle is embedded in. It is set at allocation time and is
    // intended for processing by the kubelet plugin whose name matches
    // the DriverName set in this ResourceHandle.
    //
    // The maximum size of this field is 16KiB. This may get increased in the
    // future, but not reduced.
    // +optional
    Data *string

    // If StructuredData is set, then it needs to be used instead of Data.
    StructuredData *StructuredResourceHandle
}

type StructuredResourceHandle struct {
    // VendorClassParameters are the parameters from the time that the claim
    // was allocated. They can be arbitrary setup parameters that are
    // ignore by the counter controller.
    VendorClassParameters *runtime.RawExtension

    // VendorClaimParameters are the parameters from the time that the claim was
    // allocated. Some of the fields were used by the counter controller to
    // allocated resources, others can be arbitrary setup parameters.
    VendorClaimParameters *runtime.RawExtension

   	// NodeName is the name of the node providing the necessary resources.
    // This mirrors the AllocationResult.AvailableOnNodes with a simpler
    // type.
    //
    // The driver name is the one stored in ResourceHandle.
    NodeName string

    AllocationResultModel // inline, fields must not conflict
}

// AllocationResultModel must have one and only one field set.
type AllocationResultModel struct {
    NamedResourcesWithAttributes *NamedResourcesWithAttributesResult
}

type NamedResourcesWithAttributesResult struct {
    Resources []AllocatedResource
}

type AllocatedResource struct {
   ID string // A concatenation with / of the individual names.
}
```

### Implementation of structured models

In the Go types above, all structs starting with `NamedResourcesWithAttributes`
are part of that structured model. In practice, organizing those inside their own
Go package and then importing that package in the definition of the
resource.k8s.io API will result in a cleaner separation at the source code
level. It has no impact on the resulting Kubernetes API.

### Scheduling + Allocation

The dynamic resource scheduler plugin handles the common fields of
NodeResourceSlice, ResourceClaimParameters and StructuredResourceHandle. For the
structured model fields it calls out to code that is associated with the
corresponding model.

During filtering it is decided which nodes have the necessary resources. If a
node is found, the scheduler plugin updates the resource claim status as part
of goroutine which handles pod binding.

Like a normal DRA driver controller, the scheduler also sets a finalizer to
ensure that users cannot accidentally delete the allocated claim while a pod
is about to start which depends on it. That finalizer is
"structured.dra.k8s.io/delete-protection".

### Deallocation

Deallocation is handled by kube-controller-manager when its claim controller
observes that a claim is no longer in use *and* the claim has the special
"structured.dra.k8s.io/delete-protection" finalizer. This finalizer tells the
controller that it may clear the allocation result directly instead of setting
the `DeletionRequested` field, which is what it normally would do.

Updating the claim during deallocation will be observed by kube-scheduler and
tells it that it can use the capacity set aside for the claim
again. kube-controller-manager itself doesn't need to support specific structured
models.

### Immediate allocation

Because there is no separate controller anymore, claims with immediate
allocation will only get allocated once there is a pod which needs them. The
remaining structured difference compared to delayed allocation is that claims
with immediate allocation remain allocated when no longer in use.

### Simulation with CA

The usual call sequence of a scheduler plugin when used in the scheduler is
at program startup:
- instantiate plugin
- EventsToRegister

For each new pod:
- PreEnqueue

For each pod that is ready to be scheduled, one pod at a time:
- PreFilter, Filter, etc.

Scheduling a pod gets finalized with:
- Reserve, PreBind, Bind

CA works a bit differently. It identifies all pending pods,
takes a snapshot of the current cluster state, and then simulates the effect
of scheduling those pods with additional nodes added to the cluster. To
determine whether a pod fits into one of these simulated nodes, it
uses the same PreFilter and Filter plugins as the scheduler. Other extension
points (Reserve, Bind) are not used. Plugins which modify the cluster state
therefore need a different way of recording the result of scheduling
a pod onto a node.

One option for this is to add a new optional plugin interface that is
implemented by the dynamic resource plugin. Through that interface the
autoscaler can then inform the plugin about events like starting simulation,
binding pods, and adding new nodes. With this approach, the autoscaler doesn't
need to know what the persistent state of each plugin is.

Another option is to extend the state that the autoscaler keeps for
plugins. The plugin then shouldn't need to know that it runs inside the
autoscaler. This implies that the autoscaler will have to call Reserve and
PreBind as that is where the state gets updated.

Which of these options is chosen will be decided during the implementation
phase. Autoscalers which don't use the in-tree scheduler plugin will have
to implement a similar logic.

### Test Plan

[X] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

None.

##### Unit tests

<!--
In principle every added code should have complete unit test coverage, so providing
the exact set of tests will not bring additional value.
However, if complete unit test coverage is not possible, explain the reason of it
together with explanation why this is acceptable.
-->

<!--
Additionally, for Alpha try to enumerate the core package you will be touching
to implement this enhancement and provide the current unit coverage for those
in the form of:
- <package>: <date> - <current test coverage>
The data can be easily read from:
https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#ci-kubernetes-coverage-unit

This can inform certain test coverage improvements that we want to do before
extending the production code to implement this enhancement.
-->

- `<package>`: `<date>` - `<test coverage>`

##### Integration tests

<!--
Integration tests are contained in k8s.io/kubernetes/test/integration.
Integration tests allow control of the configuration parameters used to start the binaries under test.
This is different from e2e tests which do not allow configuration of parameters.
Doing this allows testing non-default options and multiple different and potentially conflicting command line options.
-->

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html
-->

- <test>: <link to test coverage>

##### e2e tests

For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

Because of the strongly-typed versioning of resource attributes and allocation
results, the gRPC interface between kubelet and the DRA driver is tied to the
version of the supported structured models. A DRA driver has to implement all
gRPC interfaces that might be used by older releases of kubelet. The same
applies when upgrading kubelet while the DRA driver remains at an older
version.

### Version Skew Strategy

Ideally, the latest release of a DRA driver should be used and it should
support a wide range of structured type versions. Then problems due to version
skew are less likely to occur.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- [X] Feature gate
  - Feature gate name: DynamicResourceAllocation
  - Components depending on the feature gate:
    - kube-apiserver
    - kubelet
    - kube-scheduler
    - kube-controller-manager

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes. Applications that were already deployed and are running will continue to
work, but they will stop working when containers get restarted because those
restarted containers won't have the additional resources.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

Pods might have been scheduled without handling resources. Those Pods must be
deleted to ensure that the re-created Pods will get scheduled properly.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

<!--
The e2e framework does not currently support enabling or disabling feature
gates. However, unit tests in each component dealing with managing data, created
with and without the feature, are necessary. At the very least, think about
conversion tests if API types are being modified.

Additionally, for features that are introducing a new API field, unit tests that
are exercising the `switch` of feature gate itself (what happens if I disable a
feature gate after having objects written with the new field) are also critical.
You can take a look at one potential example of such test in:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97058/files#diff-7826f7adbc1996a05ab52e3f5f02429e94b68ce6bce0dc534d1be636154fded3R246-R282
-->

Tests for apiserver will cover disabling the feature. This primarily matters
for the extended PodSpec: the new fields must be preserved during updates even
when the feature is disabled.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

<!--
Try to be as paranoid as possible - e.g., what if some components will restart
mid-rollout?

Be sure to consider highly-available clusters, where, for example,
feature flags will be enabled on some API servers and not others during the
rollout. Similarly, consider large clusters and how enablement/disablement
will rollout across nodes.
-->

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

<!--
What signals should users be paying attention to when the feature is young
that might indicate a serious problem?
-->

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

<!--
Describe manual testing that was done and the outcomes.
Longer term, we may want to require automated upgrade/rollback tests, but we
are missing a bunch of machinery and tooling and can't do that now.
-->

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

<!--
Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.
-->

### Monitoring Requirements

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

<!--
Ideally, this should be a metric. Operations against the Kubernetes API (e.g.,
checking if there are objects with field X set) may be a last resort. Avoid
logs or events for this purpose.
-->

Metrics in kube-scheduler (names to be decided):
- number of classes using structured parameters
- number of claims which currently are allocated with structured parameters

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

<!--
For instance, if this is a pod-related feature, it should be possible to determine if the feature is functioning properly
for each individual pod.
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
Please describe all items visible to end users below with sufficient detail so that they can verify correct enablement
and operation of this feature.
Recall that end users cannot usually observe component logs or access metrics.
-->

- [X] API .status
  - Other field: ".status.allocation" will be set for a claim using structured parameters
    when needed by a pod.

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

<!--
This is your opportunity to define what "normal" quality of service looks like
for a feature.

It's impossible to provide comprehensive guidance, but at the very
high level (needs more precise definitions) those may be things like:
  - per-day percentage of API calls finishing with 5XX errors <= 1%
  - 99% percentile over day of absolute value from (job creation time minus expected
    job creation time) for cron job <= 10%
  - 99.9% of /health requests per day finish with 200 code

These goals will help you determine what you need to measure (SLIs) in the next
question.
-->

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

<!--
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
-->

- [ ] Metrics
  - Metric name:
  - [Optional] Aggregation method:
  - Components exposing the metric:
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

<!--
Describe the metrics themselves and the reasons why they weren't added (e.g., cost,
implementation difficulties, etc.).
-->

### Dependencies

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

<!--
Think about both cluster-level services (e.g. metrics-server) as well
as node-level agents (e.g. specific version of CRI). Focus on external or
optional services that are needed. For example, if this feature depends on
a cloud provider API, or upon an external software-defined storage or network
control plane.

For each of these, fill in the following—thinking about running existing user workloads
and creating new ones, as well as about cluster-level services (e.g. DNS):
  - [Dependency name]
    - Usage description:
      - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:
-->

### Scalability

<!--
For alpha, this section is encouraged: reviewers should consider these questions
and attempt to answer them.

For beta, this section is required: reviewers must answer these questions.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API call type (e.g. PATCH pods)
  - estimated throughput
  - originating component(s) (e.g. Kubelet, Feature-X-controller)
Focusing mostly on:
  - components listing and/or watching resources they didn't before
  - API calls that may be triggered by changes of some Kubernetes resources
    (e.g. update of object X triggers new updates of object Y)
  - periodic API calls to reconcile state (e.g. periodic fetching state,
    heartbeats, leader election, etc.)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type
  - Supported number of objects per cluster
  - Supported number of objects per namespace (for namespace-scoped objects)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - Which API(s):
  - Estimated increase:
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type(s):
  - Estimated increase in size: (e.g., new annotation of size 32B)
  - Estimated amount of new objects: (e.g., new Object X for every existing Pod)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

<!--
Look at the [existing SLIs/SLOs].

Think about adding additional work or introducing new steps in between
(e.g. need to do X to start a container), etc. Please describe the details.

[existing SLIs/SLOs]: https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-scalability/slos/slos.md#kubernetes-slisslos
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

<!--
Things to keep in mind include: additional in-memory state, additional
non-trivial computations, excessive access to disks (including increased log
volume), significant amount of data sent and/or received over network, etc.
This through this both in small and large cases, again with respect to the
[supported limits].

[supported limits]: https://git.k8s.io/community//sig-scalability/configs-and-limits/thresholds.md
-->

###### Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?

<!--
Focus not just on happy cases, but primarily on more pathological cases
(e.g. probes taking a minute instead of milliseconds, failed pods consuming resources, etc.).
If any of the resources can be exhausted, how this is mitigated with the existing limits
(e.g. pods per node) or new limits added by this KEP?

Are there any tests that were run/should be run to understand performance characteristics better
and validate the declared limits?
-->

### Troubleshooting

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.
-->

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

###### What are other known failure modes?

<!--
For each of them, fill in the following information by copying the below template:
  - [Failure mode brief description]
    - Detection: How can it be detected via metrics? Stated another way:
      how can an operator troubleshoot without logging into a master or worker node?
    - Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    - Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
      Not required until feature graduated to beta.
    - Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why.
-->

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

DRA driver developers have to give up some flexibility with regards to
parameters. They have to learn and understand how structured models
work to pick something which fits their needs.

## Alternatives

### Publishing resource information in node status

This is not desirable for several reasons (most important one first):
- All data from all drivers must be in a single object which is already
  large. It might become too large, with no chance of mitigating that by
  splitting up the information.
- All watchers of node objects get the information even if they don't need it.
- It puts complex alpha quality fields into a GA API.

### Injecting vendor logic into CA

With this KEP, vendor's use resource tracking and simulation that gets
implemented in core Kubernetes. Alternatively, CA could support vendor logic in
several different ways:

- Call out to a vendor server via some RPC mechanism (similar to scheduler
  webhooks). The risk here is that simulation becomes to slow. Configuration
  and security would be more complex.

- Load code provided by a vendor as [Web Assembly
  (WASM)](https://webassembly.org/) at runtime and invoke it similar to the
  builtin controllers in this KEP.  WASM is currently too experimental and has
  several drawbacks (single-threaded, all data must be
  serialized). https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kube-scheduler-wasm-extension
  is currently exploring usage of WASM for writing scheduler plugins. If this
  becomes feasible, then implementing a builtin controller which delegates its
  logic to vendor WASM code will be possible.

- Require that vendors provide Go code with their custom logic and rebuild CA
  with that code included. The scheduler could continue to use
  PodSchedulingContext, as long as the custom logic exactly matches what the
  DRA driver controller does. This approach is not an option when a pre-built
  CA binary has to be used and leads to challenges around maintenance and
  support of such a rebuilt CA binary. However, technically it [becomes
  possible](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kube-scheduler-wasm-extension)
  with this KEP.
