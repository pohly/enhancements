**Note:** When your KEP is complete, all of these comment blocks should be removed.

To get started with this template:

- [ ] **Pick a hosting SIG.**
  Make sure that the problem space is something the SIG is interested in taking

- [ ] **Create an issue in kubernetes/enhancements**
  When filing an enhancement tracking issue, please make sure to complete all
  fields in that template. One of the fields asks for a link to the KEP. You
  can leave that blank until this KEP is filed, and then go back to the

- [ ] **Make a copy of this template directory.**
  Copy this template into the owning SIG's directory and name it
  `NNNN-short-descriptive-title`, where `NNNN` is the issue number (with no
  leading-zero padding) assigned to your enhancement above.

- [ ] **Fill out as much of the kep.yaml file as you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Title", "Authors", "Owning-sig",
  "Status", and date-related fields.

- [ ] **Fill out this file as best you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Summary" and "Motivation" sections.

- [ ] **Merge early and iterate.**
  Avoid getting hung up on specific details and instead aim to get the goals of
  the KEP clarified and merged quickly. The best way to do this is to just
  start with the high-level sections and fill out details incrementally in
  subsequent PRs.

Just because a KEP is merged does not mean it is complete or approved. Any KEP
marked as `provisional` is a working document and subject to change. You can
denote sections that are under active debate as follows:

When editing KEPS, aim for tightly-scoped, single-topic PRs to keep discussions
focused. If you disagree with what is already in a document, open a new PR
with suggested changes.

One KEP corresponds to one "feature" or "enhancement" for its whole lifecycle.
You do not need a new KEP to move from beta to GA, for example. If
new details emerge that belong in the KEP, edit the KEP. Once a feature has become
"implemented", major changes should get new KEPs.

## Summary

<!--
This section is incredibly important for producing high-quality, user-focused
documentation such as release notes or a development roadmap. It should be
possible to collect this information before implementation begins, in order to
avoid requiring implementors to split their attention between writing release
notes and implementing the feature itself. KEP editors and SIG Docs
should help to ensure that the tone and content of the `Summary` section is
useful for a wide audience.

A good summary is probably at least a paragraph in length.

Both in this section and below, follow the guidelines of the [documentation
style guide]. In particular, wrap lines to a reasonable length, to make it
easier for reviewers to cite specific portions, and to minimize diff churn on
updates.

Dynamic resource allocation introduces a new API for requesting
arbitrary resources with parameters that can be different depending on
what kind of resource gets requested. Resource allocations can be
ephemeral (specified in a Pod spec, allocated and destroyed together
with the Pod) and persistent (lifecycle managed separately from a Pod
and used for multiple different Pods).

Resources are managed by plugins that communicate with central
Kubernetes components, in particular the kube-scheduler, by updating
objects stored in the kube-apiserver. Communication with kubelet is
handled through local Unix domain sockets and the plugin registration
mechanism, using a new plugin type and a new gRPC interface. Towards
the container runtime, kubelet and those plugins then must use the
[Container Device Interface
(CDI)](https://github.com/container-orchestrated-devices/container-device-interface)
to expose the resources.

## Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals, and non-goals of
this KEP.  Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users. The
motivation section can optionally provide links to [experience reports] to
demonstrate the interest in a KEP within the wider Kubernetes community.

-->

Originally, Kubernetes and its scheduler only tracked CPU and RAM as
resources for containers. Later, support for storage and discrete,
countable per-node extended resources was added. The device plugin
interface then made such local resources available to containers. But
for many newer devices, this approach and the Kubernetes API for
requesting these custom resources are too limited:

- *Device initialization*: When starting a workload I’d like to have
  the device reconfigured or reprogrammed by the orchestration. For
  security reasons workloads should not be able to reconfigure devices
  directly.

  *Limitation*: Currently, it’s impossible to specify the desired
  device properties that are required for reconfiguring devices.

- *Device cleanup*: When my workload is finished, I would like to have
  a mechanism for cleanup of the device, that will ensure that device
  does not contain traces/parameters/data from previous workloads and
  appropriate power state/shutdown.

  *Limitation*: Post-stop actions are not supported.

- *Partial allocation*: When deploying a container I’d like to be able
  to use part of the shareable device inside a container and other
  containers should be able to use other free resources on the same
  device.

  *Limitation*: Current implementation of the device plugin doesn’t
  allow to allocate part of the device.

- *Optional allocation*: When deploying workload I’d like to specify
  soft(optional) device requirements. If the device exists and it’s
  allocatable it would be allocated. If not - workload will be run on
  the node without a device. GPU and crypto-offload engines are
  examples of this kind of device. If they’re not available, workloads
  can still run by falling back to using only the CPU for the same
  task.

  *Limitation*: Optional allocation is supported neither by the device
  plugins nor by current Pod resource declaration.

- *Support Over the Fabric devices*: When deploying a container, I’d
  like to utilize devices available over the Fabric (PCIe, CXL,
  Network, special links, etc).

  *Limitation*: Device Plugins framework supports only local devices.

- *Access to the container image*: When deploying a container that
  needs access to a GPU device, I would like my container to
  gracefully fail to start (rather than SIGSEGV at runtime) if a
  minimum driver requirement is not met on the host.

  *Limitation*: GPU driver requirements are currently stored as labels
  on the container image, and device plugins do not have access to the
  container image.

- *Perform container runtime specific operations*: When deploying a container
  that needs access to a device, I would like to be able to reuse the
  same pod spec, irrespective of the underlying container runtime in
  use (e.g. kata vs. runc).

  *Limitation*: At present, there is no way to perform
  runtime-specific operations that may need to occur as a result of
  injecting a device into a container (device plugins are runtime
  agnostic). A good example is supporting GPU passthrough
  virtualization on kata vs. runc.

- *Access to the plugin container*: When deploying a device plugin, I
  would like to ensure that all of the operations that need to occur
  as part of “injecting” a device into a container, also occur for the
  “plugin container” itself.

  *Limitation*: At present, there is a chicken-and-egg problem to
  supporting this because the device plugin is the sole dictator of
  which containers will have these operations performed on them.

- *Device selection*: When deploying containers that perform health
  checks, monitoring, or other “control plane” operations for a
  device, I need a way to “see” all devices of a given type, but not
  consume them

  *Limitation*: Currently, there is no way to specify the equivalent
  of a “vendor.com/device: all” selector with these semantics

### Goals

<!--
List the specific goals of the KEP. What is it trying to achieve? How will we
know that this has succeeded?
-->

* More flexibility:
  * Arbitrary, resource-specific setup and cleanup actions
  * Over-the-fabric resources
  * Custom matching of resource requests with available resources
* User-friendly API for describing resource requests
* Allow resource management plugins that can be developed and deployed
  separately from Kubernetes and are independent of specific container
  runtimes.

### Non-Goals

<!--
What is out of scope for this KEP? Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.
-->

* An extension of the model that kube-scheduler has about
  resources. Instead, it will need information from the plugin for
  each resource request to determine where a Pod using the resource
  might run. The [Representing Compute Resources in Kubernetes
  proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1666PPUs4Lz56TqKygcy6mXkNazde-vwA7q4e5H92sUc/edit#)
  had some ideas what information the scheduler might need (“supports
  overcommit”, “fractional”), but ultimately any choice regarding that
  will only work for certain kinds of resources.
* A standardized way of describing available resources. Only allocated
  resources are visible through the APIs defined below. How to
  describe available resources is plugin specific because it depends
  on the kind of resource which attributes might be relevant. Plugins
  should use and document their individual approach for this (for
  example, defining a CRD and publishing through that).
* An abstraction layer for resource requests, i.e., something like a
  “I want some kind of GPU”. Users will need to know about specific
  resource plugins and which parameters they support. Portability of
  workloads could be added on top of this proposal by introducing the
  selection of a resource implementation through labels and
  standardizing those labels and the associated parameters. The
  [Resource Class
  Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qKiIVs9AMh2Ua5thhtvWqOqW0MSle_RV3lfriO1Aj6U/edit#heading=h.jzfmfdca34kj)
  included such an approach.

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation. What is the desired outcome and how do we measure success?.
The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

The proposal is that a plugin handles all operations that are specific
to the resources managed by that plugin. This includes operations at
the control plane level (tracking where in the cluster resources are
available, helping with pod scheduling decisions, allocating resources
when requested) as well as the node level (preparing container
startup). Such a plugin can be implemented in arbitrary programming
languages as long as it supports the resource allocation protocol and
gRPC interfaces defined in this KEP. An utility package with Go
support code will be made available to simplify the development of
such a plugin, but using it will not be required and its API is not
part of this KEP.

Three new API object types get added:
- ResourcePlugin, not namespaced, with a description of the plugin.
- ResourceClass, not namespaced, with privileged parameters for
  multiple resource instances of a certain kind. All these instances
  are provided by the same resource plugin, which is identified by a
  field in the class.
- ResourceClaim, namespaced, with parameters provided by a normal user
  that describes a resource instance that needs to be allocated. A
  ResourceClaim contains the usual meta data, a spec and a status. The
  spec identifies the plugin that handles the resource via a class
  name.

To support arbitrarily complex parameters, both ResourceClass and
ResourceClaim contain one field which holds a
runtime.RawExtension. Validation can be handled by plugins through an
admission controller (if desired) or later at runtime when the
parameters are passed to the plugin.

The ResourceClaim spec is read-only once created. The ResourceClaim
status is reserved for system usage and holds the current state of the
resource. The status must not get lost. This is departing from how
Kubernetes traditionally handled status, but something that more
recently [became more
acceptable](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2537). Kube-scheduler
and plugin communicate by modifying that status. The status is also
how Kubernetes tracks that a plugin has allocated the resource and on
which nodes the resource is available.

This approach is an intentional simplification compared to the PV/PVC
model for volumes because we don't need to deal with two objects when
allocating resources and therefore don't need something like the
volume binding controller. If desired, a resource plugin can implement
support for manually allocated (“static provisioning” in the context
of volumes) and/or existing resources by reacting to ResourceClaims by
using those resources to satisfy a claim.

Allocation of a resource happens either immediately (“immediate
allocation”) or when a Pod needs the resource (“delayed allocation”),
depending on a flag in the ResourceClaim spec. Pods reference resource
claims in a new PodSpec.Resources list. Each resource in that list
then can be made available to one or more containers in that Pod.  To
support ephemeral resources, an entry in the new PodSpec.Resources
list can also be a ResourceClaimTemplate. When a Pod gets created,
such a template will be used to create a normal ResourceClaim with the
Pod as owner, and then the normal allocation of the resource takes
place.

For immediate allocation, scheduling Pods is simple because the
resource is already allocated and determines the nodes on which the
Pod may run. For delayed allocation, a node is selected tentatively
and plugin(s) try to allocate their resources for that node. If that
succeeds, the Pod can start to run. If it fails, the scheduler must
determine whether some other node fits the requirements and if so,
request allocation again. If no node fits because some resources were
already allocated for a node and are only usable there, then those
resources must be released and then get allocated elsewhere.

The resources allocated for a ResourceClaim can be shared by multiple
containers in a pod. Depending on the capabilities defined in the
ResourceClaim by the plugin, a ResourceClaim can be used exclusively
by one pod at a time, by a certain maximum number of pods, or an
unlimited number of pods.

### User Stories (Optional)

<!--
Detail the things that people will be able to do if this KEP is implemented.
Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of
the system. The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting
bogged down.
-->

#### Story 1

Partial allocation.

Pod requests GPU resource with 2Gb memory:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: device-consumer
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-ubuntu
    image: ubuntu
    command: ["/bin/program"]
    resources:
    - name: gpu_2Gb
  resources:
  - name: gpu_2Gb
    template:
      resourceClassName: "gpu"
      parameters:
        memory: "2Gb"
```

This request triggers partial resource allocation on the node that has
a GPU device with 4Gb of memory for the duration of the execution of
this Pod.

If some other Pod uses 1Gb of that device, then 1Gb free GPU memory
will left on that device after the resource is allocated. It can be
used by another Pod requesting up to 1Gb of GPU memory.

#### Story 2

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

<!--
What are the caveats to the proposal?
What are some important details that didn't come across above?
Go in to as much detail as necessary here.
This might be a good place to talk about core concepts and how they relate.
-->

Scheduling is likely to be slower when many Pods request the new
resource types, both because scheduling such a Pod involves more
round-trips through the API server for ResourceClaimStatus updates and
because scheduling one Pod may affect other Pods in ways that cannot
be anticipated by the kube-scheduler. When many Pods compete for
limited resources, multiple attempts may be needed before a suitable
node is found.

The hardware that is expected to need this more flexible allocation
approach is going to be used by only a small subset of the pods in the
cluster and those pods are likely to run for extended periods of time,
so this is not a major concern.

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal, and how do we mitigate? Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
Kubernetes ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed, and by whom?

How will UX be reviewed, and by whom?

Consider including folks who also work outside the SIG or subproject.
-->

## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.
-->

ResourceClaim, ResourceClass and ResourcePlugin are new built-in types
in a new `cdi.k8s.io/v1alpha1` API group. This was chosen instead of
using CRDs because core Kubernetes components must interact with them
and installing of CRDs as part of cluster creation is an unsolved
problem.

The PodSpec gets extended.

Several components must be implemented or modified:
- A new controller in kube-controller-manager which generated
  ResourceClaims from Pod ResourceClaimTemplates, similar to
  https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/controller/volume/ephemeral
- A kube-scheduler plugin must detect Pods which reference a
  ResourceClaim (directly or through a template) and ensure that the
  resource is allocated before the Pod gets scheduled, similar to
  https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/controller/volume/scheduling/scheduler_binder.go
- Some utility library similar to
  https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/sig-storage-lib-external-provisioner
  and the code in driver-registrar: this will be developed outside of
  Kubernetes and does not have to be used by plugins, therefore it is
  not described further in this KEP.
- Kubelet must be extended to retrieve information from ResourceClaims
  and then invoke local plugin methods. It must pass information about
  the additional resources to the container runtime. It must detect
  whether the container runtime has the necessary support and
  advertise that in the cluster via node labels to simplify deployment
  of plugins and Pod scheduling.

```
<<[UNRESOLVED @pohly]>>
All of the changes in Kubernetes need to be specified in a lot more detail.

A flow diagram showing the state transitions of a ResourceClaim needs to be added.

Upgrade and downgrade scenarios should already be considered for v1alpha1 to ensure
that whatever changes will be needed are in place before going to v1beta1 where
downgrades have to be supported.

All of that will be added once there is consensus to move ahead with this proposal.
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>
```

The gRPC interface is inspired by
[CSI](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md),
with “volume” replaced by “resource” and volume specific parts
removed.

```

Do plugin operations need secrets? They are currently not part of the proposed Kubernetes API.

### Node Service RPC

#### `NodePrepareResource`

This RPC is called by kubelet when a Pod that wants to use the
specified resource is scheduled on a node.  The Plugin SHALL assume
that this RPC will be executed on the node where the resource will be
used.  The Plugin SHALL return device name and kind for allocated
device[s].

The Plugin SHALL create or update json file[s] in CDI format for each
allocated device. These files SHALL be used by runtime to update
runtime configuration before creating containers that use the
device[s].

This operation SHALL do as little work as possible as it’s called
after a pod is scheduled to a node. All potentially failing operations
SHALL be done during allocation phase.

This operation MUST be idempotent. If the resource corresponding to
the `resource_id` has already been prepared, the Plugin MUST reply `0
OK`.

If this RPC failed, or kubelet does not know if it failed or not, it
MAY choose to call `NodePrepareResource` again, or choose to call
`NodeUnprepareResource`.

After a successful call, Kubelet MUST pass device names and kinds to
the runtime through the CRI protocol.

```
<<[UNRESOLVED @bart0sh]>>
CRI protocol may need to be extended for
this purpose, e.g. device id can be added to the CRI Device structure.
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>
```

```protobuf
message NodePrepareResourceRequest {
  // The UID of the ResourceClaim. This field is REQUIRED.
  string resource_uid = 1;
}

message NodePrepareResourceResponse {
  // The map <device name>:<kind> for all allocated devices
 // where device name is a “name of the device” and kind is a
 // “kind of the device usually of the form vendor.com/device”
 // according to the CDI schema
 map<string, string> devices = 1;
}
```

##### NodePrepareResource Errors

If the plugin is unable to complete the NodePrepareResource call
successfully, it MUST return a non-ok gRPC code in the gRPC status.
If the conditions defined below are encountered, the plugin MUST
return the specified gRPC error code.  Kublet MUST implement the
specified error recovery behavior when it encounters the gRPC error
code.

| Condition | gRPC Code | Description | Recovery Behavior |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Resource does not exist | 5 NOT_FOUND | Indicates that a resource corresponding to the specified `resource_id` does not exist. | Caller MUST verify that the `resource_id` is correct and that the resource is accessible and has not been deleted before retrying with exponential back off. |
 

#### `NodeUnprepareResource`

A Node Plugin MUST implement this RPC call. This RPC is a reverse
operation of `NodePrepareResource`. This RPC MUST undo the work by
the corresponding `NodePrepareResource`. This RPC SHALL be called by
kubelet at least once for each successful `NodePrepareResource`. The
Plugin SHALL assume that this RPC will be executed on the node where
the resource is being used.

This RPC is called by kubelet when the Pod using the resource is being
deleted.

This operation MUST be idempotent. If this RPC failed, or kubelet does
not know if it failed or not, it can choose to call
`NodeUnprepareResource` again.

```protobuf
message NodeUnprepareResourceRequest {
  // The UID of the ResourceClaim. This field is REQUIRED.
  string resource_id = 1;
}

message NodeUnprepareResourceResponse {
  // Intentionally empty.
}
```

##### NodeUnprepareResource Errors

If the plugin is unable to complete the NodeUprepareResource call
successfully, it MUST return a non-ok gRPC code in the gRPC status.
If the conditions defined below are encountered, the plugin MUST
return the specified gRPC error code.  Kubelet MUST implement the
specified error recovery behavior when it encounters the gRPC error
code.

| Condition | gRPC Code | Description | Recovery Behavior |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Resource does not exist | 5 NOT_FOUND | Indicates that a resource corresponding to the specified `resource_id` does not exist. | Caller MUST verify that the `resource_id` is correct and that the resource is accessible and has not been deleted before retrying with exponential back off. |


#### Implementing a plugin for node resources

The proposal depends on a central controller plugin. Implementing that
part poses an additional challenge for plugins that so far only ran
locally on a node because they now need to establish a secure
communication path between node and controller.

How plugins implement that is up to the developer. This section
outlines a possible solution. If there is sufficient demand, common
code for this solution could be made available as a reusable Go
module.

- Each plugin defines a CRD which describes how much resources are
  available per node and how much is currently allocated.
- RBAC rules ensure that only the plugin can modify objects of that
  type. The objects can and should be namespaced, which makes it
  possible to add automatic cleanup via owner references (similar to
  CSIStorageCapacity).
- The node plugin publishes information about the local state via a
  CRD object named after the node. Plugin developers can document
  those CRDs and then users can query the cluster state by listing
  those objects.
- The controller plugin watches those objects and resource claims. It
  can keep track of claims that are in the process of being allocated
  and consider that when determining where another claim might get
  allocated. For delayed allocation, the controller plugin informs the
  scheduler by updating the ResourceClaimStatus.SuitableNodes field
  which then sets the selected node field. For immediate allocation,
  the controller plugin itself sets the selected node field.
- In both cases, the node plugin waits for a ResourceClaim assigned to
  its own node and tries to allocate the resource. If that fails, it
  can unset the selected node field to trigger another allocation
  attempt elsewhere.

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all of the test cases, just the general strategy. Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation, and anything particularly
challenging to test, should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). Please adhere to the [Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines]
when drafting this test plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

### Graduation Criteria

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Define graduation milestones.

These may be defined in terms of API maturity, or as something else. The KEP
should keep this high-level with a focus on what signals will be looked at to
determine graduation.

Consider the following in developing the graduation criteria for this enhancement:
- [Maturity levels (`alpha`, `beta`, `stable`)][maturity-levels]
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

Clearly define what graduation means by either linking to the [API doc
definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning)
or by redefining what graduation means.

In general we try to use the same stages (alpha, beta, GA), regardless of how the
functionality is accessed.

[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

Below are some examples to consider, in addition to the aforementioned [maturity levels][maturity-levels].

#### Alpha -> Beta Graduation

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Complete features A, B, C
- Tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP

#### Beta -> GA Graduation

- N examples of real-world usage
- N installs
- More rigorous forms of testing—e.g., downgrade tests and scalability tests
- Allowing time for feedback

**Note:** Generally we also wait at least two releases between beta and
GA/stable, because there's no opportunity for user feedback, or even bug reports,
in back-to-back releases.

#### Removing a Deprecated Flag

- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing flag
- Two versions passed since introducing the functionality that deprecates the flag (to address version skew)
- Address feedback on usage/changed behavior, provided on GitHub issues
- Deprecate the flag

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include 
[conformance tests].**

[conformance tests]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md
-->

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to maintain previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to make use of the enhancement?
-->

### Version Skew Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component handle version skew with other
components? What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this
enhancement:
- Does this enhancement involve coordinating behavior in the control plane and
  in the kubelet? How does an n-2 kubelet without this feature available behave
  when this feature is used?
- Will any other components on the node change? For example, changes to CSI,
  CRI or CNI may require updating that component before the kubelet.
-->

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

<!--

Production readiness reviews are intended to ensure that features merging into
Kubernetes are observable, scalable and supportable; can be safely operated in
production environments, and can be disabled or rolled back in the event they
cause increased failures in production. See more in the PRR KEP at
https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-architecture/1194-prod-readiness.

The production readiness review questionnaire must be completed and approved
for the KEP to move to `implementable` status and be included in the release.

In some cases, the questions below should also have answers in `kep.yaml`. This
is to enable automation to verify the presence of the review, and to reduce review
burden and latency.

The KEP must have a approver from the
[`prod-readiness-approvers`](http://git.k8s.io/enhancements/OWNERS_ALIASES)
team. Please reach out on the
[#prod-readiness](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CPNHUMN74) channel if
you need any help or guidance.
-->

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting alpha to a release.
-->

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

<!--
Pick one of these and delete the rest.
-->

- [ ] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name:
  - Components depending on the feature gate:
- [ ] Other
  - Describe the mechanism:
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control
    plane?
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning
    of a node? (Do not assume `Dynamic Kubelet Config` feature is enabled).

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

<!--
Any change of default behavior may be surprising to users or break existing
automations, so be extremely careful here.
-->

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

<!--
Describe the consequences on existing workloads (e.g., if this is a runtime
feature, can it break the existing applications?).

NOTE: Also set `disable-supported` to `true` or `false` in `kep.yaml`.
-->

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

<!--
The e2e framework does not currently support enabling or disabling feature
gates. However, unit tests in each component dealing with managing data, created
with and without the feature, are necessary. At the very least, think about
conversion tests if API types are being modified.
-->

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can a rollout fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

<!--
Try to be as paranoid as possible - e.g., what if some components will restart
mid-rollout?
-->

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

<!--
What signals should users be paying attention to when the feature is young
that might indicate a serious problem?
-->

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

<!--
Describe manual testing that was done and the outcomes.
Longer term, we may want to require automated upgrade/rollback tests, but we
are missing a bunch of machinery and tooling and can't do that now.
-->

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

<!--
Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.
-->

### Monitoring Requirements

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

<!--
Ideally, this should be a metric. Operations against the Kubernetes API (e.g.,
checking if there are objects with field X set) may be a last resort. Avoid
logs or events for this purpose.
-->

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

<!--
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
-->

- [ ] Metrics
  - Metric name:
  - [Optional] Aggregation method:
  - Components exposing the metric:
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the above SLIs?

<!--
At a high level, this usually will be in the form of "high percentile of SLI
per day <= X". It's impossible to provide comprehensive guidance, but at the very
high level (needs more precise definitions) those may be things like:
  - per-day percentage of API calls finishing with 5XX errors <= 1%
  - 99% percentile over day of absolute value from (job creation time minus expected
    job creation time) for cron job <= 10%
  - 99,9% of /health requests per day finish with 200 code
-->

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

<!--
Describe the metrics themselves and the reasons why they weren't added (e.g., cost,
implementation difficulties, etc.).
-->

### Dependencies

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

<!--
Think about both cluster-level services (e.g. metrics-server) as well
as node-level agents (e.g. specific version of CRI). Focus on external or
optional services that are needed. For example, if this feature depends on
a cloud provider API, or upon an external software-defined storage or network
control plane.

For each of these, fill in the following—thinking about running existing user workloads
and creating new ones, as well as about cluster-level services (e.g. DNS):
  - [Dependency name]
    - Usage description:
      - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:
-->

### Scalability

<!--
For alpha, this section is encouraged: reviewers should consider these questions
and attempt to answer them.

For beta, this section is required: reviewers must answer these questions.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API call type (e.g. PATCH pods)
  - estimated throughput
  - originating component(s) (e.g. Kubelet, Feature-X-controller)
Focusing mostly on:
  - components listing and/or watching resources they didn't before
  - API calls that may be triggered by changes of some Kubernetes resources
    (e.g. update of object X triggers new updates of object Y)
  - periodic API calls to reconcile state (e.g. periodic fetching state,
    heartbeats, leader election, etc.)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type
  - Supported number of objects per cluster
  - Supported number of objects per namespace (for namespace-scoped objects)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - Which API(s):
  - Estimated increase:
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type(s):
  - Estimated increase in size: (e.g., new annotation of size 32B)
  - Estimated amount of new objects: (e.g., new Object X for every existing Pod)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

<!--
Look at the [existing SLIs/SLOs].

Think about adding additional work or introducing new steps in between
(e.g. need to do X to start a container), etc. Please describe the details.

[existing SLIs/SLOs]: https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-scalability/slos/slos.md#kubernetes-slisslos
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

<!--
Things to keep in mind include: additional in-memory state, additional
non-trivial computations, excessive access to disks (including increased log
volume), significant amount of data sent and/or received over network, etc.
This through this both in small and large cases, again with respect to the
[supported limits].

[supported limits]: https://git.k8s.io/community//sig-scalability/configs-and-limits/thresholds.md
-->

### Troubleshooting

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.
-->

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

###### What are other known failure modes?

<!--
For each of them, fill in the following information by copying the below template:
  - [Failure mode brief description]
    - Detection: How can it be detected via metrics? Stated another way:
      how can an operator troubleshoot without logging into a master or worker node?
    - Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    - Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
      Not required until feature graduated to beta.
    - Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why.
-->

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this KEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

### ResourceClaimTemplate

Instead of creating a ResourceClaim from an embedded template, the
PodStatus could be extended to hold the same information as a
ResourceClaimStatus. Every component which works with that information
then needs permission and extra code to work with PodStatus. Creating
an extra object seems simpler.

### Reusing volume support as-is

ResourceClaims are similar to PersistentVolumeClaims and also a lot of
the associated logic is similar. An [early
prototype](https://github.com/intel/proof-of-concept-cdi) used a
custom CSI driver to manage resources.

The user experience with that approach is poor because per-resource
parameters must be stored in annotations of a PVC due to the lack of
custom per-PVC parameters. Passing annotations as additional parameters was [proposed
before](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-provisioner/issues/86)
but were essentially [rejected by
SIG-Storage](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-provisioner/issues/86#issuecomment-465836185)
because allowing apps to set custom parameters would make apps
non-portable.

The current volume support also has open issues that affect the
“volume as resource” approach: Multiple different Pods on a node are
allowed to use the same
volume. https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2489 will
address that, but is still work in progress.  Recovery from a bad node
selection during delayed binding may get stuck when a Pod has multiple
volumes because volumes are not getting deleted after a partial
provisioning. A proposal to fix that needs further work
(https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1703).  Each “fake”
CSI driver would have to implement and install a scheduler extender
because storage capacity tracking only considers volume size as
criteria for selecting nodes, which is not applicable for custom
resources.

### Extend volume support

The StorageClass and PersistentVolumeClaim structs could be extended
to allow custom parameters. Together with an extension of the CSI
standard that would address the main objection against the previous
alternative.

However, SIG-Storage and the CSI community would have to agree to this
kind of reuse and accept that some of the code maintained by them
becomes more complex because of these new use cases.

### Extend Device Plugins

The Device Plugins API could be extended to implement some of the
requirements mentioned in the “Motivation” section of this
document. There were certain attempts to do it, for example an attempt
to [add ‘Deallocate’ API call](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1949) and [pass pod annotations to 'Allocate' API call](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61775)

However, most of the requirements couldn’t be satisfied using this
approach as they would require major incompatible changes in the
Device Plugins API. For example: partial and optional resource
allocation couldn’t be done without changing the way resources are
currently declared on the Pod and Device Plugin level.

Extending the Device Plugins API to use [Container Device Interface](https://github.com/container-orchestrated-devices/container-device-interface)
would help address some of the requirements, but not all of them.

It should be also taken into account that Device Plugins API is
beta. Introducing incompatible changes to it may not be accepted by
the Kubernetes community.
